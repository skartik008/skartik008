### Hi, I am Kartik Siddhabathula ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as Engineer II with Starbucks on the Android application. 

Some of the major project highlights of my association with Starbucks are

1. Auto re-run the failed tests on jenkins
2. Ensure android emulator api-31 works on jenkins 

I would love to learn more on build engineering side / SRE and would love to move to SRE role in the future.
